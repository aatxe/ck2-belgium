# Crusader Kings 2: Kingdom of Belgium

This fairly simple mod adds a decision to create Belgium as an independent Duke. It features a Coat of Arms derived from the real Belgian Coat of Arms, and will automatically shift the requisite domains (Flanders, Brabant, Lower Lorraine) into the de jure realm of Belgium.

Requirements:
* Frankish, French, German, or Dutch Culture
* Completely holds the duchies of Flanders, Brabant, and Lower Lorraine
* Independent Ruler
* Rank of Duke

Once Belgium has been created, new events will allow the culture to shift to a Belgian melting pot culture. With a Belgian ruler, Belgian counties will receive additional events that increase the number of holdings in de jure Belgian counties.
